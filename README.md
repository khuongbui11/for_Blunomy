# Car Crash Data Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains code and analysis for the Car Crash dataset. The main aim is to explore the data, visualize the patterns, and predict the severity of accidents based on various features.

## Directory Structure:

- **Data Analysis Jupyter Notebook**:
  - **File**: `Data Analysis.ipynb`
  - **Description**: This notebook contains code that deals with the exploration and visualization of the Car Crash dataset. It encompasses:
    - Data Exploration
    - Data Cleaning
    - Data Visualization

- **Machine Learning Model Jupyter Notebook**:
  - **File**: `Machine Learning Model.ipynb`
  - **Description**: This notebook contains machine learning models developed to predict the severity of accidents. Models covered include:
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
    - Neural Network

## Features for Prediction:

The models predict the `Severity` of the accident based on the following features:
- `ACCIDENT_TIME`
- `DAY_OF_WEEK`
- `LIGHT_CONDITION`
- `SPEED_ZONE`
- `SURFACE_COND`
- `ATMOSPH_COND`
- `LGA_NAME`

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository_link]`.
2. Ensure you have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed.
3. Navigate to the directory and open the desired notebook.
4. Execute the cells in the notebook to perform data analysis or to train/test the machine learning models.
